# 🚇 DMRC-Route-Navigator

A Python-based route planner for Delhi Metro using graph traversal algorithms (BFS/DFS) and a Flask backend for real-time route suggestions.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

**DMRC Route Navigator** is a smart navigation system built using Python that helps users find optimal routes in the Delhi Metro network. It utilizes graph traversal techniques to identify the shortest paths and provides direction-based guidance using a minimal Flask interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Find shortest routes using BFS & DFS
- ✅ JSON-based data parsing for metro stations
- ✅ Detects line changes & interchanges
- ✅ Flask backend for input/output interface
- ✅ Custom route annotation and direction output

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Breadth First Search (BFS)** – To find the shortest route
- **Depth First Search (DFS)** – For alternate route exploration
- **Graph Theory** – To represent metro stations and interconnections
